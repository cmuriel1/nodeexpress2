Authentication Routes in Node.js

Bug: The User.authenticate function in the login route was not awaited.
Solution: I suggested adding await before User.authenticate in the login route.


User Routes in Node.js

Suggestion: I recommended handling 404 errors explicitly in the GET and DELETE routes when a user is not found.

Middleware Functions
Improvement: I recommended using jwt.verify for token verification in the authUser middleware.


ExpressError Class
Improvement: I suggested setting the name property in the ExpressError constructor for consistency.

createToken Function
Improvement: I suggested adding an expiration time (expiresIn) for the token to enhance security.
