### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
JSON Web Token (JWT), often pronounced as "jot," is a standardized and open specification (RFC 7519). It outlines a concise and self-contained method for securely exchanging information between different entities using a JSON format. It's important to note that while all JWTs are tokens, not every token adheres to the JWT standard.



- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
The signature in a JSON Web Token (JWT) ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token. It is generated using a secret key and includes information from the header and payload. The signature allows verification of both the token's content integrity and the source authenticity.



- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
Yes, if a JWT is intercepted, the attacker can decode and view the payload since the information is base64-encoded, not encrypted.


- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
User Login:
User logs in, and the server generates a JWT containing user details.
JWT is signed with a secret key.


Token Issued:
Server sends the signed JWT to the client.
Client stores the JWT securely.

Token Usage:
Client includes JWT in requests for authentication.

Token Verification:
Server verifies the JWT signature using its secret key.
Extracts user details from the decoded payload.

User Authorization:
Server authorizes the request based on user permissions.

Token Expiration:
JWT often includes an expiration time.
Server checks expiration for validity.


- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
Unit Tests:
Scope: Individual components.
Purpose: Verify isolated functionality.
Speed/Complexity: Fast, low complexity.

Integration Tests:
Scope: Interactions between components.
Purpose: Verify component integration.
Speed/Complexity: Slower, moderate complexity.

End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
Scope: Entire application/system.
Purpose: Verify system functionality.
Speed/Complexity: Slowest, high complexity.



- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
Things You Would Mock:
External Services: Simulate API calls.
Database Queries: Mimic database interactions.
Third-Party Libraries: Replicate external functions.
File Systems: Simulate file operations.
Network Requests: Mimic HTTP requests.
Complex Objects: Simplified replicas for testing.
Time Functions: Control time-related behavior.
User Input: Simulate UI interactions.
Purpose:
Isolation: Test independently.
Controlled Behavior: Determine specific behaviors.
Efficiency: Speed up tests.
Deterministic Tests: Ensure consistent outcomes.



- What is continuous integration?
Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently and automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository, allowing for early issue detection, consistent builds, and efficient collaboration in software development


- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
An environment variable is a dynamic value external to a program, influencing its behavior. Used for storing configuration details like system paths, API keys, and application settings, they ensure adaptability and portability without modifying source code, allowing software to function seamlessly across various environments


- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the corresponding code. Benefits include improved code quality, faster bug detection, and design clarity. Drawbacks may involve initial time investment and potential overemphasis on test coverage.


- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
JSONSchema provides a standardized way to define the structure and constraints of JSON data. It ensures data integrity, facilitates documentation, and promotes interoperability by allowing consistent validation across systems.


- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
Prioritize testing critical business logic, error-prone functionalities, and code with frequent changes. Focus on user inputs, boundary conditions, and complex algorithms to ensure comprehensive test coverage.


- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
RETURNING in SQL retrieves data generated by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, allowing immediate access to affected rows. It is useful when you need to obtain and work with the values of modified rows in a single query, reducing additional database interactions.


- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
Web Sockets provide full-duplex communication with lower latency, enabling real-time bidirectional data exchange. HTTP is request-response-based, suitable for stateless communication. Web Sockets are persistent connections, while HTTP is stateless and requires new connections for each request



- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
No preference; choice depends on project requirements. Flask is lightweight for small projects, while Express is robust for scalable applications. Preference based on simplicity, language familiarity, and ecosystem support.
